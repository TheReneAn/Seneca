1.What was good about using arrays - what were the alternatives 
(how else could you have done it)?

When we needs to create more data, we for group management. 
In this case, what is used in programming is arrays.
It is easy to group and manage multiple data in one name of array.
Moreoverm, accessing is fast because it accesses all data directly through the index.
In addition, number of information can be efficiently processed when combined with a iteration structure.

If arrays was not used, it would needlessly be done manually with the same operation.
And I should use many of variables.

For instance,
int High1, High2, High3;

printf("Day 1 - High: ");
scanf("%d", &Hight1); // use sanf and get the value into Hight1

printf("Day 2 - High: ");
scanf("%d", &Hight2); // use sanf and get the value into Hight2

printf("Day 3 - High: ");
scanf("%d", &Hight3); // use sanf and get the value into Hight3

But I can use arry. It's more celar and useful.
for (i = 0; i < NUM; i++) {
	printf("Day %d - High: ", i + 1);
	scanf("%d", &Hight[i]); // use sanf and get the value into Hight[i]
}


2. Comment on the use of parallel (matching) array's. In what ways were they good and/or bad?

int Hight[10], Low[10];
In the small project, parallel array is really useful to organize different type of data.
For example, I used the High array and Low array in my code.
I can get data from the arrays, what I want to data by using index.
But, if I developed a big project, I could get a mistake by using parallel array.
In the big project, it's better to use 'structure'.


3. Iterating (looping) through arrays is a common practice; 
why is it a best practice to initialize iterator variables to a value of zero (0)?

'For' is the best practice to initialize iterator variables to a value of zero.

If I want to execute as many as an array using one variable, you must initialize it.
For instance, 
avgLow = 0, avgHigh = 0;
// total_Low = 0, total_High = 0;

for (i = 0; i < nbdays; i++) {
	avgHigh += Hight[i];
	avgLow += Low[i];
}

printf("\nThe average temperature up to day %d is: %.2lf", nbdays, (avgHigh + avgLow) / (nbdays * 2));


Each room in High and Low array is use avgLow, avgHigh.
So, If I don't initialize avgLow and avgHigh, avgHigh and avgLow add continually.
