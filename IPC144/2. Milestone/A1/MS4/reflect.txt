Assignment: 1

Milestone:  4

----------------------------------------------

1. Explain what you learned from doing milestones three and four

I learned about dividing file system in c.
I found out that I can put prototype of functions in header file. 
Moreover, I can use two c files using the Pointer.
I learned how to convey data using functions.

2. An explanation of why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, 
Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.

In my case, I think that students in IPC144 are required practicing of 'pointer' and 'adress'.
By intentionally creating the Contact structure that holds tree other structs, we are helped understand their concept.
But we can call other structs easily.

3. An explanation why it would be poor design to pass a pointer to type Contact as an argument 
in the functions getName, getAddress, and getNumbers.

I don't need to use Contact struct. 
I can get data as Name using 'Name' struct.
