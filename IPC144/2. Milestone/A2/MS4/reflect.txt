1. Explain what you learned from doing milestones three and four.

There are many interesting things in the milestones three and four.

First, modify this function to ensure all values entered are numerical digits.
I didn't guess that a user could do mistake during writing own phoneNum.
For example, they could write down "111-222-3333"
In this case, we can not use '-'. And, phoneNum arry cannot accept this length.
So, I checked phonNum using ASCII.
for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
	if ('9' < phoneNum[i] || phoneNum[i] < '0') { // ASCII 
	printf("Enter a 10-digit phone number: ");
	needInput = 1; break;
} }

Next, I've realized sort Function. 
Using this Function, I can check results clearly.
I really want to study about Algorithm.

2. An explanation of how the two functions findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone benefit your source code with respect to overall maintenance and readability.

Two functions include validation.
And many others functions can use these functions. In other words, function reuse is possible.
When I use these funtions, I don't need to make same codes.
Reduced complexity, increased cohesion

3. Would you have liked this assignment to include the functionality to load/save the contact information from/to a text data file? Explain your decision.

I can make the function that can use a file.
A file is a named area of secondary storage.
I can output people information to the file.

For example, 


         FILE *fp = NULL;

         fp = fopen("contacts.txt","w");
         if (fp != NULL) {
            for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		if (strlen(contacts[i].numbers.cell) != 0) {
			displayContact(&contacts[i]);
			count++;
		}
	}
                 fclose(fp);
         } else {
                 printf("Failed to open file\n"); 
         }
