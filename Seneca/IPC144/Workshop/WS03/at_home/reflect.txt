1. How did pseudo-coding the solution beforehand help with the coding part? 
If you didn't use pseudo code (or prepare some kind of an outlined answer), 
think about your experience and either justify your method or explain why it may have been
better to plan ahead.

Outline allows you to plan the overall structure of writing in advance so that the direction of writing does not end with unintended conclusions, 
and can help you further refine your ideas by writing in a format that advances from large, common ideas to detail.

2. There are 3 types of iteration constructs. 
What ones did you use in your program, and why?

I used two types of iteration in the code: "for" and "while."
The for construct groups the initialization, test condition and change together, separating them with semi-colons.
I wanted to check all rooms in the array, so I used the for construct.
Therefore, I was able to check the array from 0 to the end of array.

Moreover, the while construct executes its sequence as long as the test dondition is true.
Because your condition, I had to receive limted data from a user until the it was right as  
"high must be greater than low, high must be less than 41, low must be greater than - 41."
By using "while", it was succesful to get the right data.

3. What did you find interesting and/or difficult about this workshop?
It was interesting and rewarding to see the results as I planned.
I used 'array' for the first time after I learned, 
so it was difficult to figure out the structure of 'array' in the code.
It was difficult to use the sequencing in 'for' and 'while'.
