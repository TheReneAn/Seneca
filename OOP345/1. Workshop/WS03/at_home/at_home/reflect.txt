1. the reason for specializing the `sum()` member function.
- A template specialization defines an exception to a template definition. 
  Main function uses the 'int' and 'string' form.
  The 'sum()' member function needs to use specializing for 'string' due to can not use the '+'.
    
2. the reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.
- It must set initial value by using specializing for each type.
  For example,
	// the initial value for summation should be set to 0.
	template<>
	int PairSummable <string, int> ::init_val = 0;
  We don't know 'string' and 'int' valuse may come.

3. the reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.
- The static variable 'init_val' in a class should be defined again outside of the class to use the variable.

   For example,
	class PairSummable : public Pair<K, V> {

		// holds the initial value for starting a summation
		static V init_val;

4. I learned how to design (instantiation) and code class templates.
   Additionally, I learned how to use a static variable in a class.
   Coding specializations parts was much hard for me.
   I should study a lot about this part.
