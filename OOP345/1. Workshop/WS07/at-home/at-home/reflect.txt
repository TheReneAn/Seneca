1. List all the STL functions that you have used in this workshop; 
explain your reasoning for choosing each one, and not another.
- 1) <iostream>: standard iostream objects. primary mechanism for input and output
2) <string>: For example, I can use this library like 'std::string s_artist;' I can also use c-stlye.
3) <vector>: contiguous storage of variable size
	    The vector class template defines classes that manage data structures that can change in size but have their elements ordered in sequence.
	    'std::vector<Song> s_Song;'
4) <list>: non-contiguous storage of variable size, doubly linked list
	The list class template defines classes that manage doubly linked sequences that are optimized for insertion and removal of elements anywhere throughout the list, particularily in larger sequences.
	'std::list<Song> getSongsForArtist(std::string str) const;'
5) <fstream>: The fstream header file contains the definitions of all file stream classes.

	      'std::ifstream file(is);'
6) <iomanip>: formatting and manipulation, helper function
	       'out << "| " << std::left << std::setw(20) << theSong.s_title'
7) <algorithm>: standard algorithms
	         The algorithm function templates define common operations to be performed on ranges of elements in a sequence. 
	         'std::sort(s_Song.begin(), s_Song.end(), [](const Song& lhs, const Song& rhs)'
8) <cstring>: null-terminated sequence utilities
	     'return lhs.s_length < rhs.s_length;'


2. Present the advantages of using STL algorithms vs. implementing the functionality by yourself using loops.
- Using STL containers is more optimized, and they're faster, clearer, and more idiomatic than anything you can write yourself.

3. The function that sorts the collection of songs receives as a parameter the field name to use; 
This can create errors if the client specifies an invalid field (or misspells it). 
How would you redesign that function to prevent the client to specify an invalid string, 
allowing any error to be detected by the compiler?
- I would make a validation function to check the field name.
Or, I would use a function in the facility library.
