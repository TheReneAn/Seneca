1. Learned in completing this particular workshop

I've learned to retrieve records from a text file using an input file stream object since WS01.
Furthermore, I used "the std::chrono" library. It was so complicated for me.
But I searched for it a lot. And I could understand it.
Additionally, I implemented copy & move semantics for a class with a resource.

2. the reason for the significant time difference between the copy and move operations

Moving files on the same medium are much faster, as instead of copying actual data, 
the file index instead is rewritten to indicate that the files are in a different folder, while the actual data is left exactly where it is.

Generally, Moving files will be faster because when moving, it will just change the links, not the Actual Position on the physical device.
While copying will actually read and write the information to other place and hence takes more time.
